Hello! I'm Johnry and this is my awesome website hosted by the power of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). I set this site up as an exercise in front-end web development as Im pretty pants at it, the fact that I haven't made the internet implode is a sign that I've done something right. Yay!

It's early days for this site so there isn't much content, but rest assured I shall fill it with much hapiness and win.

So stay tuned!
