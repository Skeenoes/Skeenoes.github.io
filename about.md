Hello! I'm Johnry and I am a software developer whol likes trying out new tech. This is my awesome website hosted by the power of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). I set this site up as an exercise in web development as I'm pretty pants at it, the fact that I haven't made the internet implode is a sign that I've done something right. Nice!

I don't have much content so for now here is a photo of a cute dog.
